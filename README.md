# Crypto-Mart
Ethereum Decentralized React Application.It is a simple DAPP where you can buy the listed products with ethers(using metamask).
The Dapp also updates the real time wallet balance of the Seller(the deployer of the contract) and Buyer as you purchase the products.
It also toggles the Owner's ID from the seller's account to buyer's account as you buy a product.
The Smart Contract behind the application is written in Solidity using Truffle framework.
It uses Reactjs for the client end and Ganache UI as local blockchain for deployment purposes.
